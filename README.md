# Arsenic.exe-resources

Arsenic.exe is a GDI malware that I have been working on for about two weeks. This repository has the ByteBeat sound that arsenic will produce while displaying payloads. A payload6.wav does not exist since that payload uses Beep() function. Arsenic is programmed in C++ by the way.
